Developed a Call In Sick application built with Angular,Node.js & Python whose aim is to provide a utility for company
employees to prove their sickness call by going into a live session completely controlled and validated by AI.


• The application assures that the user is not cheating and is alone in the session, only one medical device is allowed per
session (e.g. thermometer),and assures that the user is always in clear view in the session. Any suspicious activity in the
session kicks the user out of the session.
• The application captures device reading using OCR and submits user reading to the manager.
• It uses 3 main modules which are Object Detection and Classification (using YOLOv8), Real Time Face Recognition, and
Optical Character Recognition “OCR”
